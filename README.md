Hi! My name is Tommaso and I am working on Pseduomonas aeruginosa and more bacteria pathogens affecting Cystic Fibrosis patients.
I am glad to join GitHub community and I think this platform may be useful to improve my knowledge and creating new automatic pipelines by following expert SCIENTIST.
We are currently creating automated pipelines for annotating P. aeruginosa genome from whole-genome sequencing analysis. We are a small laboratory in Florence in Meyer Paediatric Hospital
and we are interested in genetic background and genetic changes in the most common bacteria affecting these little patients, e.g. P.aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex,
Staphylococcus aureus, etc...).
I am enthusiastic about our work. Hope we will get great results.

Thank you all! 
Good work! May the force be with you!
